This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). Follow these steps to get started with Aora:

### 1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Upon starting, you’ll have options to open the app in:
